        My Proposal

    <p> The central concept of my final project revolves around the fictitious truth that life is a grand simulation, almost like a video game. This idea assumes that our experiences, challenges, and relationships are not random occurrences but are orchestrated by an unseen force, much like the mechanics of a simulation game such as The Sims. This belief suggests that every decision we make and every encounter we have could be part of a larger design aimed at fostering personal growth and connection. This topic is of significant interest to me. Growing up playing The Sims, I found joy in the ability to control various aspects of life, from relationships to careers, creating a world that mirrored real life but allowed me to manipulate outcomes. This gameplay experience fostered a sense of agency and creativity, where I could experiment with different scenarios and see the consequences. It was a space where the ordinary could become extraordinary, and I could explore lifeâ€™s possibilities without real world consequences.</p>
