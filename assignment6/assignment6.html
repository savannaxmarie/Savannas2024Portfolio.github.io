    <p> Psychologist Viktor Frankl, in his seminal work Man’s Search for Meaning, discusses how finding meaning in our experiences can lead to greater resilience. He asserts, “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” Viewing life as a simulation can offer individuals a framework to interpret challenges as part of a larger narrative, promoting a proactive approach to obstacles. This shift in perspective can cultivate emotional resilience, enabling people to navigate life's uncertainties more effectively.</p>
