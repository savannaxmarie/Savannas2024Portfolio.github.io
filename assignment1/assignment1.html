    <p>I decided to focus on <em>Facebook vs. Tweens (and Russian Grandmothers)</em> subsection of Wagners. The transition from Myspace to Facebook marks a shift in internet culture and design, showing broader changes in user preferences and societal values. Myspace, which reached its highest point in the mid 2000s, was a platform where users could customize their pages extensively. This customization included everything from flashy backgrounds and glittering gifs to embedding music on your profile! The result was a personal web experience that allowed users to express their individuality.</p> 

    <p>Olia Lialina's observations on this era reveal the obvious contrast between early and later web aesthetics. Lialina notes that “non-professional user pages differ from the professional ones just as clearly as a decade and a half ago,” highlighting how Myspace’s DIY vibe made it a space of personal expression, in contrast to the more controlled and polished environment that followed with Facebook (Lialina, 2006).”  Myspace pages were often cluttered, featuring a multitude of colors, fonts, and animations that reflected the user’s personality and creativity. This period was marked by a sort of digital experiment where users had the freedom to build their online spaces in unique ways.</p>

    <p>However, as the mid 2000s progressed, Facebook began to take over. Facebook’s design was minimalist and uniform, which contrasted with the highly customizable Myspace pages. This change wasn’t just about aesthetics; it signified a shift in user demographics and cultural values. Danah Boyd's research provides insight into this transition, explaining that Facebook’s clean design was part of a broader trend toward a more professional and less chaotic online environment. Boyd compares this shift to “urban white flight,” where users moved from the “ghetto” of Myspace’s cluttered and amateur design to Facebook’s more refined atmosphere (Boyd, 2006).”  This transition was driven in part by a desire for social status and the thought of Facebook as a more prestigious platform.</p> 

    <p>Boyd’s research shows how different social classes and racial dynamics influenced this move. As mentioned in the article, Myspace was associated with a lower social status and a less desirable online presence, while Facebook was seen as a more upscale and professional space. The shift was not only about personal preference but also about aligning oneself with a platform that symbolized higher social aspirations. Facebook’s association with prestigious institutions like Harvard and its later connections to other elite schools reinforced its image as a high-class platform.</p> 

    <p>Myspace, once a symbol of the early internet’s creative freedom, began to decline. The website made headlines when it removed most of its user-generated content, including custom profiles, blogs, and posts. This abrupt removal was a striking example of how temporary digital content can be. Lialina supports this with the observation that “the average half-life of a website is a shocking two years. (Lialina, 2006).”</p>

    <p>The loss of Myspace’s personal pages and creative designs was significant. Many users had invested time and energy into crafting their online identities, and the sudden removal of these pages left a gap in the digital historical record. Despite this, Myspace’s style continues to influence contemporary web culture. Platforms like Neocities and the continued use of customizable themes on websites like Tumblr show that there is still an audience for the kind of creative expression that Myspace represented.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, the transition from Myspace to Facebook reflects a broader shift in internet culture from personal creativity to professional polish. This change is not simply about design but also about how we value and experience digital spaces. The decline of Myspace and the rise of Facebook mark a move towards a more controlled and status-driven online environment, leaving behind the freewheeling creativity that characterized the early internet. Preserving the history of this earlier, more personal web is crucial for understanding the full spectrum of digital evolution.</p>
