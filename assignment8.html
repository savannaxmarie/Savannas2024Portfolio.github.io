<p id="whatever">Query once ruled the web like a knight in shining armor, making it easy to add interactive elements to websites. But as browsers evolved and JavaScript grew more powerful, jQuery became the equivalent of using a hammer to push in a nail. It's bloated with unnecessary code, adds extra HTTP requests, and forces developers to rely on an abstraction that modern JavaScript can handle natively—without needing to download a 90KB library. It's like carrying around a Swiss Army knife when all you need is a screwdriver. In the age of ES6 and beyond, it’s just another outdated tool in the back of the toolbox.</p>
