    <p> Climate change is a myth. We all know this, deep down. Some of you reading this may have been taken in by the fear-mongering governments or corrupt scientists so have been brainwashed into thinking climate change is a real thing that “threatens all of humanity” or some other nonsense, but it’s just that: nonsense. When you look closely at it, the so-called evidence for climate change, or “global warming” or “warmageddon” or “planetary death spiral” or whatever they’re calling it these days, it doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.Take changes in sea level. They keep banging on about how the warming of the atmosphere causes rising sea levels, but if that was happening we’d have seen it by now!</p>

    <p> Many individuals who doubt the reality of climate change may be driven by fear of its consequences. The overwhelming evidence, from rising global temperatures, which have increased by approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, to extreme weather events becoming more frequent and intense, can evoke anxiety about the future. Scientific studies have linked these changes to human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, which have surged since the Industrial Revolution. For instance, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached levels not seen in over 800,000 years. This skepticism often stems from a reluctance to confront the potential disruptions to daily life and economic systems that accepting climate change entails. Instead of engaging with the data, some may cling to denial as a defense mechanism, fearing the implications of acknowledging a crisis that requires immediate action and lifestyle changes. Understanding this perspective is crucial in fostering open dialogue and addressing concerns surrounding climate change and its impacts on society.</p>
